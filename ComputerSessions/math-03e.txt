Computer exercises (3)

1. Create the vector
  x <- sample(c("H","T"), size=1000, replace=T)

2. Create a function that measures the length of longest run of heads in a sequence of 1,000 coin tosses. Apply it to the 
  vector x created in the preceding exercise.

 Solution:
 x <- sample(c("H","T"), size=1000, replace=T)
y <- as.numeric(x=="H")
n <- min(which(y==1))
z <- y[1:n]
for(i in (n+1):1000) z[i] <- ifelse(y[i]==0, 0, z[i-1]+1)
max(z)
